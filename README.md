# What is the Generator Generator?
The Generator Generator allows you to create and configure your own Generator.

Do you want some ideas for cartoon scenarios to draw? Bam! No problem. Need project ideas for a Hackathon? Use the Hackathon Idea generator. Want a character name for your new D&D campaign? We can do that. Need a title for your new Robert Ludlum fan fiction? Got you covered.

Importantly, you can create your own if you need to randomly generate anything else. The possibilities are endless!
